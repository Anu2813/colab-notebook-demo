# ICP 4 – Big Data Analyticss

It demonstrates data manipulation using pandas, data cleaning, filtering, and visualization.
## Tasks Completed
 Create and manipulate DataFrames
 Read and clean external CSV data
 Perform statistical analysis
 Filter data with conditions
 Drop and convert columns
 Create scatter plot for Duration vs Calories

## ICP 5: ML Pipeline with RandomizedSearchCV and Custom Dataset

### Dataset
- **Iris.csv**: A multiclass classification dataset with flower measurements and species labels.

### Tasks completed
Loaded the `iris.csv` dataset
Split into features (X) and target (y)
Built a pipeline with:
StandardScaler for feature scaling
PCA for dimensionality reduction
Classifier (RandomForestClassifier)
 Used `RandomizedSearchCV` for hyperparameter tuning
Evaluated model performance using:
  - 3-fold CV
  - 5-fold CV
  - 7-fold CV

### Outcome
Successfully built and evaluated a machine learning pipeline using `RandomizedSearchCV` and custom CSV input with consistent, high-performing results.
